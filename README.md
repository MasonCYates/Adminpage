# Adminpage
Admin Page for Odin

I plan to do a few release for this as this will be the first page I do for my Bug Tracker app I would like to make. 

List of tasks

- Research an icon for each page link on the dashboard.
- Research Icons for the rest of this page.
- Create Skeletons (These will be the other pages once I have built them.) for each of the links so that it shows they work.(This will be implemented later on)
- Time to css the page the body background will be back and for the main page i want the borders rounded. 
- once most of the page is decorated I need to figure out how to make it so when i press New it wilkl let me open a project page and work and save it.(in the save I would like it to inster project into one of the 6 avaiable spots and then I would like it to show the title and a description of the latest work done. )
